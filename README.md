## RxBuddies

A library that has utility classes that emit Activity events (lifecycle, Activity and permission results) for your reactive Android app.

The library is extracted from [Pakoito's](https://github.com/pakoito) [Functional Android Reference](https://github.com/pakoito/FunctionalAndroidReference) project. It is his work. I have extracted the useful parts for a unidirectional data-flow architecture that I am adopting.

This micro-library is a work in progress.
